# Getting Started

This guide walks you through setting up Ubuntu Miracast Server from scratch — from verifying hardware compatibility to receiving your first wireless screen cast.

## 1. Verify Prerequisites

### Hardware

You need a Wi-Fi adapter that supports **P2P (Wi-Fi Direct)**. Most modern Intel and Qualcomm adapters do.

```bash
# Check if your Wi-Fi adapter supports P2P
iw phy | grep -A 5 "Supported interface modes"
# Look for "P2P-device" or "P2P-GO" in the output
```

If you see `P2P-device`, `P2P-client`, and `P2P-GO` listed, your adapter is compatible.

**Known compatible adapters:**
- Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX200/AX201/AX210
- Intel Wireless-AC 8265/9260
- Qualcomm Atheros QCA6174/QCA9377

### Software

| Requirement | Minimum Version | Check Command |
|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu | 24.04 LTS | `lsb_release -a` |
| Python | 3.10 | `python3 --version` |
| GStreamer | 1.20 | `gst-launch-1.0 --version` |
| GTK 4 | 4.6 | `pkg-config --modversion gtk4` |
| wpa_supplicant | 2.10 | `wpa_supplicant -v` |

### wpa_supplicant Configuration

wpa_supplicant must be configured with P2P support. On Ubuntu 24.04, the default NetworkManager setup typically handles this. Verify:

```bash
# Check that wpa_supplicant is running with P2P
sudo wpa_cli interface
# Should show a "p2p-dev-wlanX" interface
```

If no P2P interface appears, you may need to configure wpa_supplicant manually:

```bash
# /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
update_config=1
device_name=Ubuntu-PC
device_type=1-0050F204-1
p2p_go_intent=15

# Restart
sudo systemctl restart wpa_supplicant
```

## 2. Install System Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install \
    python3-gi python3-gst-1.0 \
    gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-adw-1 \
    gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0 gir1.2-gst-plugins-base-1.0 \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
    wpasupplicant
```

**Recommended extras:**

```bash
# Hardware-accelerated video decoding (VA-API for Intel/AMD)
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-vaapi intel-media-va-driver

# DHCP server for P2P Group Owner mode
sudo apt install dnsmasq

# Development tools (if building from source)
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip git
```

## 3. Install Ubuntu Miracast Server

### Option A: From Source (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arongate/ubuntu-miracast-server.git
cd ubuntu-miracast-server

# Create virtual environment with system site-packages
# (required so Python can access GTK and GStreamer system bindings)
python3 -m venv .venv --system-site-packages
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the package in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
ubuntu-miracast-server --help
```

### Option B: From Debian Package

```bash
# Download the .deb file from releases
sudo apt install ./ubuntu-miracast-server_1.0.0-1_all.deb
```

### Option C: Using uv (fast Python package manager)

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/arongate/ubuntu-miracast-server.git
cd ubuntu-miracast-server
uv venv .venv --python /usr/bin/python3 --system-site-packages
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

## 4. First Run

### Launch the Application

```bash
ubuntu-miracast-server
```

You should see the GTK window appear with the message "Waiting for Miracast source..." and your Wi-Fi adapter will begin advertising as a Miracast sink.

### Connect a Source Device

From your source device:

1. **Android:** Settings → Display → Cast / Wireless Display → Enable → Select "Ubuntu Miracast Server"
2. **Windows 10/11:** Settings → System → Display → Connect to a wireless display (or Win+K)
3. **Ubuntu (with ubuntu-miracast-client):** Launch the client and select your server from discovered devices

### What Happens

1. The app starts a dedicated wpa_supplicant on the secondary Wi-Fi adapter
2. A P2P Group Owner is created — making the server discoverable
3. A WPS PIN is displayed on the screen
4. You select "Ubuntu Miracast Server" on your phone's Wi-Fi Direct / Cast list
5. Enter the PIN shown on the server screen
6. The P2P connection forms (WPS exchange)
7. RTSP negotiation establishes streaming parameters
8. The source begins streaming H.264 video (+ AAC audio)
9. Video appears in the server window

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Single-Radio Wi-Fi Limitation (Concurrent Connection Failure)

**Symptom:** PIN exchange succeeds, "P2P-GO-NEG-SUCCESS" appears in logs, but the connection drops immediately with `EAP-FAILURE` or `Authentication request to the driver failed`.

**Cause:** Most laptop Wi-Fi adapters have a single radio that cannot simultaneously maintain your regular Wi-Fi connection (e.g., to your home router on channel 11 / 2.4 GHz) AND a P2P group connection (typically on 5 GHz). When the P2P group tries to form on a different frequency, the driver fails.

**This affects:** Intel AX200/AX201/AX210, most single-radio adapters when connected to a router.

**Solutions (pick one):**

1. **Use a secondary USB Wi-Fi adapter** (recommended) — the app automatically detects a dedicated adapter and spawns a separate wpa_supplicant instance for it. Your built-in Wi-Fi stays connected to the internet. Known working adapters:
   - TP-Link AXE5400 Archer TXE70UH (Realtek RTL8852CU, driver: `rtw89_8852cu`)
   - Any adapter with P2P-client/P2P-GO support (`iw phy | grep P2P`)

2. **Disconnect from your Wi-Fi router before casting**:
   ```bash
   # Disconnect from home WiFi
   nmcli device disconnect wlo1
   
   # Start the server
   ubuntu-miracast-server
   
   # After casting, reconnect
   nmcli device connect wlo1
   ```

3. **Use Ethernet** for internet connectivity instead of Wi-Fi, freeing the wireless adapter for P2P.

> **Note:** This is a hardware/driver limitation, not a software bug. The P2P protocol negotiation works correctly — the failure occurs at the driver level when attempting concurrent multi-channel operation.

### "No P2P interface found"

Your Wi-Fi adapter doesn't expose a P2P device interface via wpa_supplicant.

```bash
# Verify wpa_supplicant is running
sudo systemctl status wpa_supplicant

# Check for P2P interfaces
sudo wpa_cli interface

# If using NetworkManager, it may manage wpa_supplicant differently
nmcli device wifi list  # Verify WiFi is up
```

### "Failed to enable wifi_display"

wpa_supplicant may not support the `wifi_display` feature. Ensure you have version 2.10+ and it was compiled with CONFIG_WIFI_DISPLAY=y.

### Black screen after connection

The GStreamer pipeline may not have the required decoder plugins:

```bash
# Verify decoder availability
gst-inspect-1.0 avdec_h264
gst-inspect-1.0 tsdemux
gst-inspect-1.0 rtpmp2tdepay

# If missing, install:
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad
```

### No audio

```bash
# Verify AAC decoder
gst-inspect-1.0 avdec_aac

# Verify PulseAudio/PipeWire sink
gst-inspect-1.0 pulsesink
```

### Permission issues with wpa_cli

The application uses `sudo wpa_cli` for P2P operations. Ensure your user can run wpa_cli:

```bash
# Add to wpa_supplicant group (if available)
sudo usermod -aG netdev $USER

# Or configure sudoers for passwordless wpa_cli
echo "$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/wpa_cli" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/miracast
```

- [Service Mode](service-mode.md) — run headless as a systemd service
- [Architecture](architecture.md) — understand the internals
